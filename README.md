# LaTeX 2D and 3D models illustrating Bayesian reasoning

This repository contains LaTeX code and its resulting PDF. It creates 2D and 3D models that illustrate a process of Bayesian reasoning. Specifically, the 3D models illustrate such reasoning using a product space of propositions.

The models are used in a paper titled "Existential Bias," which can be downloaded from www.casperstormhansen.com.
